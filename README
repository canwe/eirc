Please see the LICENSE file

== Compiling ==
Just run make.

== Example ==
To run a client with a bot attached do the following:

1) Compile
    $ make

2) Open a shell E.g. (from the eirc root dir).
    $ erl -pa ../eirc/ebin

3a) In the Erlang shell type (formatting for clarity):
    > application:start(eirc).
    ok

    > {ok, Client} = eirc:start_client(mybot, [{bots, [{example_bot, eirc_example_bot, []}]}]).
    Initiating bot...
    {ok,<0.39.0>}

3b) Another way of using using a bot is to install it
    > {ok, Client} = eirc:start_client(mybot, []).
    {ok,<0.39.0>}

    > eirc:install_bot(mybot, example_bot, eirc_example_bot, []).
    Initiating bot...
    ok

4) Connect the client and interact and what not   
    > eirc:connect_and_logon(Client, "irc.freenode.net", 6667, "mazenharake").
